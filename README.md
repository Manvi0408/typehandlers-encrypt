# typehandlers-encryption
 Description:
Due to company security requirements, it became necessary to encrypt sensitive data stored in the database. Because the number of affected fields is large, manual encryption and decryption would be tedious and involve extensive code changes. A simpler and more generic solution was needed.
The typehandlers-encrypt project was created in this context. It allows for encryption and decryption of specified database fields with minimal configuration and without changing business logic, significantly reducing the impact on users.
